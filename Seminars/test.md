**What is large scale requirement engineering?**

 Requirement engineering process for large scale complex products is called large scale requirements engineering.  This plays a vital role in the development of complex software-intensive systems and in market-driven development.
 
**What are the challenges in large-scale requirements engineering?**

As large-scale requirements engineering involves dealing with a huge number of requirements it involves various challenges, unlike normal requirements engineering process. Some of the challenges are taken  from ((Requirements Engineering in the Development of Large-Scale Systems)) follows:

 -  A Large number of requirements- difficult to specify analyses and prioritization.
 - 	Complex customer meetings- getting feedback in case of ambiguity is a time-consuming process.
 - 	Reaching expectations – due to the complexity of product ensuring the early prototypes does meet customer expectations.
 - Technology advancement – complex products take a long time to develop by when there is a possibility that a new advanced technology is introduced to the market.
 - Scope creep and changes – Research have proven that scope of the project changes frequently  during its development in such case customer requirements and milestones  should be taken care of
 - Traceability – Considering the number of requirements traceability becomes a complex task.


**What is the order of magnitude of the number of requirements we are discussing?** 

Order of magnitude of requirements in a large-scale requirement engineering process is approximately between 1000 - 10000 requirements.

 **GAP / CVA / IVA Analysis** 
 
 *GAP*: It is a technique that is used by product level management to identify the gap between current state and desired state and determine the steps to reach this state. It consists of 

 - Identifying and listing the factors such as performance of the product, competencies of the present situation (WHAT IS) 
 - Determining steps needed to achieve future desired state ("what should be") which helps in highlighting the gaps that are to be filled.
Gap analysis helps the company to understand who it is and also gives clarity about the way it wants to be in future.


*CVI:* It is a technique that assesses the place of the organization with respect to similar organizations in the marketplace. It involves:

 - 	Define customer value and Identity how that value influences potential customers.
 - Quantify the value as per the developed product or service.
 - Compare your value with competitor’s customer value either better or worse on each aspect the customer value.
 - Then use this observation to predict the future.


*IVA:*   Internal Value Analysis helps in evaluating the product with respective to the company strategies.

**What tools are available for Continuous Integration?** 

It is the part of agile software development. Continuous integration (CI) is support by many tools some of those tools are:

| OPEN SOURCE:                     | COMMERCIAL TOOLS:                      |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|

**What is technical product management?** 

 Technical product management involves the tasks like, defining market requirements and allotting them to different product releases. Management tasks are more “How to develop” driven rather than “what to develop”.
 
**What is road mapping? How can you do it large scale?**

 Roadmapping is a technique followed for planning and describing the use technological and scientific resources, elements and their relationships over a certain period of time. Roadmapping helps in improving development process by providing early information by long term decision making. Which in

**Read up on the Boston Matrix**

Boston Matrix is the tool used for product portfolio analysis and management. It is an in formal tool which is developed by the Boston Consulting Group in the early 1970. This tool uses the degree of market share and market growth to identify the necessity of resources to maximize the product management oriented profit.
 Market share (X-Axis): it is the percentage of the total market that the organization attained. Market share is measured in terms of revenue i.e. higher market share means higher financial benefits. 
Market growth (Y-Axis): It is the count of total potential customers using the product. 

| Problem Children 	| Starts    	|
|------------------	|-----------	|
| Dogs             	| Cash Cows 	|

Impact of Market share and Market growth on product portfolio is done using four categories. 
Dogs, cash cows, question marks (or problem children) and stars.
*Dogs* suffer from low market share and low market growth problems. Investment dominates the profit (breakeven will be reached). Usually dogs are sold or closed.

*Cash cows* have high market share and low market growth. These products results in high profits and there is no scope of improvement or no excess opportunities are available. As the name specifies cash cows should be “milked” as long as possible. 

*Problem children* have low market share and high market growth. These products require huge amount of resources by profit obtained is very low. They can grow their market share and thus increases profits, which turns them into stars or cash cows. There is also possibility for them to degrade into dogs which will reduce the profits. These types so products are also called question marks as they are to be analyzed carefully or the investment would be wasted.

*Starts* have ideal combination with high market share and more market growth. These products result in both profits and further opportunities.

**How do you connect your requirements to your architecture?** 

Requirements specify what product is to be build. Architecture depicts how system is organized and how it behaves given a situation. As requirements specify the problem and architecture gives a high level solution to that problem, therefore we can say that Architecture depends on the requirements.

**Can you connect all requirements directly? What do you do if you cannot?**
	All requirements cannot be directly connected to architecture. This might be because some of the requirements are not mature enough to connected to architecture. Maturity depends on the level of detail of the requirement and level of its understanding by the architect. In this case those requirements should be revisited and steps to understand it more should be taken. These steps include conducting meetings with the requirements or owner, conduct interviews  as the requirement ‘s target personal etc.
