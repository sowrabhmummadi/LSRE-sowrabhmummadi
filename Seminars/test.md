**What is large scale requirement engineering?**

 Requirement engineering process for large scale complex products is called large scale requirements engineering.  This plays a vital role in the development of complex software-intensive systems and in market-driven development.
 
**What are the challenges in large-scale requirements engineering?**

As large-scale requirements engineering involves dealing with a huge number of requirements it involves various challenges, unlike normal requirements engineering process. Some of the challenges are taken  from ((Requirements Engineering in the Development of Large-Scale Systems)) follows:

 -  A Large number of requirements- difficult to specify analyses and prioritization.
 - 	Complex customer meetings- getting feedback in case of ambiguity is a time-consuming process.
 - 	Reaching expectations – due to the complexity of product ensuring the early prototypes does meet customer expectations.
 - Technology advancement – complex products take a long time to develop by when there is a possibility that a new advanced technology is introduced to the market.
 - Scope creep and changes – Research have proven that scope of the project changes frequently  during its development in such case customer requirements and milestones  should be taken care of
 - Traceability – Considering the number of requirements traceability becomes a complex task.


**What is the order of magnitude of the number of requirements we are discussing?** 

Order of magnitude of requirements in a large-scale requirement engineering process is approximately between 1000 - 10000 requirements.

 **GAP / CVA / IVA Analysis** 
 
 *GAP*: It is a technique that is used by product level management to identify the gap between current state and desired state and determine the steps to reach this state. It consists of 

 - Identifying and listing the factors such as performance of the product, competencies of the present situation (WHAT IS) 
 - Determining steps needed to achieve future desired state ("what should be") which helps in highlighting the gaps that are to be filled.
Gap analysis helps the company to understand who it is and also gives clarity about the way it wants to be in future.


*CVI:* It is a technique that assesses the place of the organization with respect to similar organizations in the marketplace. It involves:

 - 	Define customer value and Identity how that value influences potential customers.
 - Quantify the value as per the developed product or service.
 - Compare your value with competitor’s customer value either better or worse on each aspect the customer value.
 - Then use this observation to predict the future.


*IVA:*   Internal Value Analysis helps in evaluating the product with respective to the company strategies.

**What tools are available for Continuous Integration?** 

It is the part of agile software development. Continuous integration (CI) is support by many tools some of those tools are:

| OPEN SOURCE:                     | COMMERCIAL TOOLS:                      |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|

| Integrity                        |                                        |

**What is technical product management?** 

 Technical product management involves the tasks like, defining market requirements and allotting them to different product releases. Management tasks are more “How to develop” driven rather than “what to develop”.
 
**What is road mapping? How can you do it large scale?**

 Roadmapping is a technique followed for planning and describing the use technological and scientific resources, elements and their relationships over a certain period of time. Roadmapping helps in improving development process by providing early information by long term decision making. Which in
