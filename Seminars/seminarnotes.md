– “The art and science of release planning”, plus some more recent works on the EVOLVE methods
Summary
According to Ruhe and Sailu incremental development helps in understanding the stakeholder’s preferences by facilitating the possibility of early feedback and also add early value to the product which help the organizations to build user expected products. This process can be enhanced by effective release planning. Release planning involves identifying and selecting features necessary for successive releases satisfying budget, resources, and risk constraints. It also involves human hunch,
Most of the research planning techniques used in industries are informal and ad-hoc which make this process not so promising this can be because of organization lack of attention towards the process or lack of maturity about the process.
Even though planning is mentioned in Standards like CMM,ISO they don’t explain how exactly to achieve better results
Research planning can be better implemented in agile development as planning has physical involvement of important stakeholders for respective set of features and these set being small. Even in agile development there are no predefined set of methods followed in planning that yield better results.
Plan driven development also suffers these disadvantages.
The process of releasing planning manually becomes exponentially complex as number of requirements increases.
Formalize the problem to get better meaningful results.

Anthony Bagnall and his colleagues	Assigning weights to the customers	
Ho-Won Jung’s approach	Maximum value for minimum cost	 
Drawback: Don’t not involve stakeholders in research planning decisions
Mark Denne and Jane Cleland-Huang’s
incremental funding method11	Focus on revenue projection	
Penny’s maintenance planning.	Release monitoring (available effort, required effort)	 
RP constraints are not considered

Factors to be considered for release planning :  Decision variables, Feature dependencies (Coupling and precedence dependencies), Resource constraints (Identify the resources available), Stakeholders, Feature prioritization, objective function (urgency, risk, satisfaction or dissatisfaction, and return on investment)
Release planning can be more effectively implemented by actually identifying the need for strong methodology, formulating objectives which involve impacting criteria rather than only considering the importance of features. Better data collection techniques to get more accurate and limited data to evaluate. 



A Case Study Evaluation of the Guideline-Supported QUPER Model for Elicitation of Quality Requirements Richard Berntsson Svensson and Bjorn Regnell
Release planning plays a major role in market driven development where the organizations compete in open market. To survive competition organization should be able to bring new, innovative, necessary features as early as possible to market which requires better more formal release planning. Along with value of the features considering quality requirements acts as added advantage. This article provides practitioners’ view of Quality Performance (QUPER) model by providing results of case study conducted in a company on mobile handset domain which has 24 professionals.
	Methods that consider strategic quality requirements for release planning are very less, one such method is QUPER.it addresses quality and cost constraints for a requirement.
EVOLVE II is the method used for released planning and which considers quality aspects of the requirements. It usually assigns cost between functionality and quality requirements.
Ex: 90% for functionality and 10% for quality
Drawback: level of quality necessary is not identified.
QUPER and EVOLVE II can be used combined to achieve better results.
WHEN IS THE QUALITY LEVEL GOOD ENOUGH..?      It is the tough question when it comes to identifying the quality.
Introducing Support for Release Planning of Quality Requirements
– An Industrial Evaluation of the QUPER Model
In this paper authors tries to answer questions relating to performance, value, cost, benefit that can occur during release planning.
E.g. would slightly better performance significantly more valuable form market perspective?
Main purpose of this paper is to figure out the implementation of QUPER in Industry. This is done by conducting a case study at sony errison a mobile handset company. QUPER model doesn’t evaluate quality based on either its good or bad instead it evaluates quality as the different levels of scales of goodness. Quality is non-linear continuous graph when evaluated with cost, benefit. Further generic QUPER model is tailored as per the company and a case study is conducted. Based on the evaluation results it can be understood that applying QUPER during release planning will have added advantage understanding, evaluating quality which leads to the better performance of the product in the market.
