– “The art and science of release planning”, plus some more recent works on the EVOLVE methods
Summary
According to Ruhe and Sailu incremental development helps in understanding the stakeholder’s preferences by facilitating the possibility of early feedback and also add early value to the product which help the organizations to build user expected products. This process can be enhanced by effective release planning. Release planning involves identifying and selecting features necessary for successive releases satisfying budget, resources, and risk constraints. It also involves human hunch,
Most of the research planning techniques used in industries are informal and ad-hoc which make this process not so promising this can be because of organization lack of attention towards the process or lack of maturity about the process.
Even though planning is mentioned in Standards like CMM,ISO they don’t explain how exactly to achieve better results
Research planning can be better implemented in agile development as planning has physical involvement of important stakeholders for respective set of features and these set being small. Even in agile development there are no predefined set of methods followed in planning that yield better results.
Plan driven development also suffers these disadvantages.
The process of releasing planning manually becomes exponentially complex as number of requirements increases.
Formalize the problem to get better meaningful results.

Anthony Bagnall and his colleagues	Assigning weights to the customers	Drawback: Don’t not involve stakeholders in research planning decisions
Ho-Won Jung’s approach	Maximum value for minimum cost	 
Mark Denne and Jane Cleland-Huang’s
incremental funding method11	Focus on revenue projection	RP constraints are not considered
Penny’s maintenance planning.	Release monitoring (available effort, required effort)	 

Factors to be considered for release planning ¾  Decision variables, Feature dependencies (Coupling and precedence dependencies), Resource constraints (Identify the resources available), Stakeholders, Feature prioritization, objective function (urgency, risk, satisfaction or dissatisfaction, and return on investment)
Release planning can be more effectively implemented by actually identifying the need for strong methodology, formulating objectives which involve impacting criteria rather than only considering the importance of features. Better data collection techniques to get more accurate and limited data to evaluate.
